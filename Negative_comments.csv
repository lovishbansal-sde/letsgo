""Honestly I appreciate you and your content < Technical Analysis is good but I find It truly baffling that major crypto youtubers just look mostly at pure T.A and completely ignore the bigger narrative of why BTC is pumps/pumped and why the future outlook will be even rosier than it seems. It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 6 BTC from day trad!ng with Paulson Dmitriev insights and charts.

""I'd like to add that in the mid 50 minute mark it's said that """"majority rules"""" on the blockchain and that's how we decide who is right. This isn't quite right. One of the most genius parts of blockchain is that we can tell which is right by checking which is longest. Because the computational power needed to produce a new block keeps getting harder, there is no way for a single entity to keep up with all the other people solving for the nonce. So if one person tries to maliciously change a block, they'll just fall behind on producing the rest of the chain and then we know they are the bad actor because their chain fell behind in length.

Of course, if 51% of miners all decide to change a block in the same way, then they could actually keep up, which is the concept of a 51% attack.""

""on the pytest segment, for those not used to testing that may be wondering why to test. I want to point out that in this example Patrick indeed just called  directly the functions from the brownie framework, which is kind of redundant (he kind of tested a third party framework which is not really useful), but you should imagine a situation, that he packed all these function calls within a function defined by himself. Then you start testing your own code and whenever you make changes to it that changes the expected output, the test will fail and you will know right away that something is wrong.""

How many ppl even have had 1 developer job. It just seems like this industry is impossible. I've been to college which was a waste of money and prolly salty bc I never got a job and I owe money. I'm curious to see how many ppl actually have crypto dev jobs. Alot of these projects don't even pay though. And if they pay they r looking for absolute EINSTEINS. These companies want experienced devs not I just learned a language on YouTube lol. That is hard truth. It's going to take years and years to get good at Solidity. Its a very very very hard language. Now if you already have a dev job obviously your in. But anyone trying to learn this with no experience is a death wish
