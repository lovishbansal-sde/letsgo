If anyone got this, you forgot a "":"" on the brownie-config.yaml
in my case i put my private key right after the ""from_key"" identifier causing this error
the "":"" allows the config reader to see that the private key value is seperate from the from_key: identifier"

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps, narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 6 BTC from day trad!ng with Paulson Dmitriev insights and charts.

"Interesting consideration, have to consider digital land probably won't function like physical land obviously  but I see application. The issue right now is no one can foresee where this space is heading. Metaverse is an obvious choice in purchasing land as it's backed by FB but when I bought my VR headset a lot of people didn't want to have any association with FB like having to create an account to access their VR profile. I think if fears of future pandemics persist people will be more willing to stay home and interact on VR for shopping and social events, not to mention viewing events in other countries without the costs of flying, etc. There's a lot of potential and opportunity to integrate with cryptocurrency when you deal with the right source like *VirtualCryptoMinesüü°Com* but there's probably a long way until a platform exists for it."

I am not saying the tutorial is bad, its just that I have no experience/knowledge of the crypto world and is too difficult for me to get the bigger picture.

"I'd like to add that in the mid 50 minute mark it's said that ""majority rules"" on the blockchain and that's how we decide who is right. This isn't quite right. One of the most genius parts of blockchain is that we can tell which is right by checking which is longest. Because the computational power needed to produce a new block keeps getting harder, there is no way for a single entity to keep up with all the other people solving for the nonce. So if one person tries to maliciously change a block, they'll just fall behind on producing the rest of the chain and then we know they are the bad actor because their chain fell behind in length.

Of course, if 51% of miners all decide to change a block in the same way, then they could actually keep up, which is the concept of a 51% attack."

"It gets really unclear here: https://youtu.be/M576WGiDBdQ?t=11323

""We sent this contract some money and there is no way to get it back""

First of all it's not clear what the fund() function is actually supposed to do. How about naming it something explicit, such as fundFromUserToDeveloper (if that's what it's supposed to do)?

Next, how can funds be sent to a contract? Where is the ether actually? It doesn't make sense to me who is new to blockchains.

So I don't understand why we need a withdraw function. Who is going to withdraw and from where?

Furthermore, this far into the tutorial I don't remember any explanation of Solidity explicit keywords (if they are keywords) such as address and msg.

Anyway, thanks for an otherwise great tutorial!"

""This function can be used to pay for thus"". Pay for what?

""Every function call has an associated value"". Every function call? So why is this one payable?

Then you hit the pay button, then enter a value, then hit the pay button again. Doesn't really make sense what you are doing here. Why would you hit the pay button twice? Is that really how it works? And where does that money go when you hit the button twice?"

"I'm still a long way to complete all 16+ hours of the video. But I have this observation. At 18:30: If your computer and backup computers go down, in regular world, your data is gone. At 19:20: All you need to access your data is a private key, essentially a password. So if you store/save your private key/password in your computer/backup computers and they all go down (no human will be able to memorize the private key), then although your data is sill somewhere, but it's no good because you can't access it anyway. So if the solution is to save the private key in some cloud-based password manager company, then the control is just shifted from a bank to a cloud password company."

How many ppl even have had 1 developer job. It just seems like this industry is impossible. I've been to college which was a waste of money and prolly salty bc I never got a job and I owe money. I'm curious to see how many ppl actually have crypto dev jobs. Alot of these projects don't even pay though. And if they pay they r looking for absolute EINSTEINS. These companies want experienced devs not I just learned a language on YouTube lol. That is hard truth. It's going to take years and years to get good at Solidity. Its a very very very hard language. Now if you already have a dev job obviously your in. But anyone trying to learn this with no experience is a death wish
!,@,#,$,%,U,^,&,*,(,)
It's funny because everyone says there's all these jobs. I've been working my @$$$$ off for 2 years solid and I still don't have a dev job. Now I am trying this but I feel like everyone flocks to the latest and greatest thing and it's over saturated. Unfortunately I can't even get a html email developer job. If anyone knows how to get in I am all ears.
