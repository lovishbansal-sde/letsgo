""Content creating is the hardest passive income to get into in general. Basically, you have to have the network of an influencer and that takes years (8 in your case). This is great info for aspiring content creators, I would say there are much better ways to make complete passive  income through high apy, diverse assets and etc. These are definitely real ways to make passive income and I appreciate your transparency at the beginning of how hard it is to do it. My advice is take a something you're already good at and build on it more or find a capital to start investing with *VIRTUALCRYPTOMINES🟡COM* . If you play an instrument make sound bits, if you write release a book, have an eye for clothes? Thrift and up sale in your own store.

""I hold high respect for your work mate because you're pointing people in the right direction. If there's one thing I've learnt recently is to remain calm especially when it comes to investment in cryptocurrency.
Let's not panic and sell when when everything goes down and do not buy in euphoria when everything goes up. I advise everyone to forget predictions and start making profits now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses. The trade market is unstable and you can't easily tell if it's going bullish or bearish.
While Myself and my colleagues are trading without fear of  incurring loses, others are being patient for the price of skyrocket.  It all depends on the pattern you follow.
Thanks to Mrs Stephanie for her trading tips, she's the best broker I've ever come across.""

At 19:20: All you need to access your data is a private key, essentially a password. So if you store/save your private key/password in your computer/backup computers and they all go down (no human will be able to memorize the private key), then although your data is sill somewhere, but it's no good because you can't access it anyway. So if the solution is to save the private key in some cloud-based password manager company, then the control is just shifted from a bank to a cloud password company.""

""very informative video you have here, there are several reasons why investment advisors and high net worth investors including major Banks are recognising the benefits of Bitcoin in their strategic  asset allocation. Key among them are portfolio diversification, the upside potential versus other assets, and future adoption potential with others like ETFs. (countries like Germany are taking the lead already). So far my trading experience has been awesome for years with the teachings of career trader Isaac Steward who has been my portfolio strategist. I started with little over 4BTC, so far  i've accumulated more than 6BTC after taxes.""
